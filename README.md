# Unity game: Rock, Paper, Scissors
This is a very simple and very quickly made version of rock, paper, scissors made on Unity for a school assignment. The code isn't great, but it works and is according to the requirements of the school assignment. The game is controlled with a mouse by simply pressing the rock, paper, or scissors button, then the game will randomly pick an opposing option. After that, the score is determined by the standard rules:

- Rock beats scissors;
- Paper beats rock;
- Scissors beat paper;
- When the computer and the player pick the same, the score doesn't change.

That's all, folks.
